### How to use
1. First, you should [install the F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it's an alternative app store for Android.
2. In the F-droid app, navigate to Settings > Repositories.
3. Click the + floating action button to add a new repository. 
4. Click *SCAN QR CODE* and scan the QR below:

    </p>

    Alternatively, you can also add the repository manually with the following url:

      ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaneschepke/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=0890C5D44C0109E366801C39840325E810E21B270B9D2AEC53CE0D6C5FC849DB
    ```

4. You can now install my apps, e.g. start by searching for "WG Tunnel" in the F-Droid client.

Please note that some apps published here might contain [Anti-Features](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/). If you can't find an app by searching for it, you can go to settings and enable "Include anti-feature apps".

### For developers
